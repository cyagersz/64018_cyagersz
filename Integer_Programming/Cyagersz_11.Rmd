## Introduction

AP is a shipping service that guarantees overnight delivery of packages in the continental US.
The company has various hubs at major cities and airports across the country. Packages are
received at hubs, and then shipped to intermediate hubs or to their final destination.
The manager of the AP hub in Cleveland is concerned about labor costs, and is interested in
determining the most effective way to schedule workers. The hub operates seven days a week,
and the number of packages it handles varies from one day to another.
